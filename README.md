## FAQ

**Q: Can we connect on LinkedIn?**

**A:** A lot of people use LinkedIn in different ways. I try to use it to keep track of people that I have worked with and have a good working relationship with. If you really want to be connected with me on LinkedIn, then let's first work together on a project.

**Q: Can you give a talk at my event?**

**A:** Yes, I'm always happy to give talks at events but I do need to work around my work and family schedules as well as manage travel costs.

**Q: I found a mistake in something you've published, what should I do?**

**A:** That's awesome, way to go! You can let me know and I'll do my best to fix it quickly.
